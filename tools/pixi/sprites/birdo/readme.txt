Birdo by mikeyk (optimizations by Blind Devil)

This file just contains some info on CFG files.

birdo_smb2.cfg - the Birdo miniboss sprite.
carryable_egg.cfg - the egg projectile that Birdo can spit and that can be picked up and thrown back to hurt it.
birdo_fire.cfg - the fireball projectile that Birdo can spit.

Birdo has various defines in the ASM file, including the values for spawned sprites, hitpoints, and other stuff.
Also, extra bit determines if it'll just spit a single type of sprite, or will randomly alternate between spitting
two types of sprites.
