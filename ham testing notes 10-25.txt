General

Let's go ahead and patch out spin jump auto-fireballs
Bonus Game still needs disabling
Maybe some HUD tweaks since half the stuff in it doesn't matter

0-1
Make sure every Pipe Lakitu has a disposal chute near it
Blue tint added here isn't helping the Mario/Peach color confusion even if it is map accurate
Block dispenser between the two fire Piranhas makes it too easy

0-2
Little bit of gray ground left near the 5th Dragon Coin
No way to backtrack for that coin without getting hurt when you notice it
Bit of pillar cutoff right at the end

1-1


1-2
Feels too short... or maybe I just wanted to hear more of the song
Might want another visual pass (no "ruins" theming yet, and 3D space is a little confusing with non-semi solid ground appearing both in front of and behind the water)
Inviting the player to stomp down into ? blocks implies they'd actually activate
No real reason to follow the blue coins down while spinning/stomping
Lot of empty water and open sky just off the intended path, implying nonexistent secrets / allowing some skips

1-3

3-1
Fix classic piranha vines still being fish
I think we wanted to redesign the 2nd Dragon Coin area a bit upon learning climbable semisolids let you go down?
Lot of free Dragon Coins in this one, even if the first one is intentional

3-2
Weird thing going on with Layer 3 priority here
Not sure how I feel about wood-colored stone pillars or wood submerged in lava
Question blocks at the end seem like they should be more of a bonus than a requirement

3-3
Game lags near some of the Hotheads
Boss room Hothead is clever but it despawning may catch casual players off-guard, maybe use reskinned Spiny Blocks instead?
Need a mixed ExGFX for the Hothead in the boss room if it stays

4-1
Lots of lag around the Goomba stacks
Might want another visual pass (same comment re: 3D space, and feels overreliant on basic pillars)

4-2
First saw often despawns, should be placed all the way to the right
Rhino Gate (TM) seems a little rough when combined with getting out of water
Might want another visual pass (same comment re: 3D space, and orange water under a blue sky in a "lava" level would imply that it's unsafe)
Cloud platforms seem like an opportunity to use semisolids more thematic to the hack like wood or mushrooms
Free mushroom just for the last saw is a little odd
It was mentioned we should change the shell ending to not have softlock potential

4-3
