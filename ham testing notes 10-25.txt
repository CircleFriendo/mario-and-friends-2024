General

Let's go ahead and patch out spin jump auto-fireballs
Bonus Game still needs disabling
Maybe some HUD tweaks since half the stuff in it doesn't matter
Peach's cape still has that blue tile
Need a proper intro screen without the default intro text
It was mentioned we should go around and make the Peach color more distinct and consistent -- maybe other "character colors" should too?
Title screen palette is missing the text colors, besides the title screen's other more pressing issue (dying)

0-1
Make sure every Pipe Lakitu has a disposal chute near it
Maybe red pipes should be stark red and not pinkish like the grass / character colors shouldn't be influenced by lighting in general
Block dispenser between the two fire Piranhas makes it too easy

0-2
Little bit of gray ground left near the 5th Dragon Coin
No way to backtrack for that coin without getting hurt when you notice it
Bit of pillar cutoff right at the end

1-1
Background structure and mushroom platforms use the same color outline, may want to use different palette
Have to wrestle with the camera a bit to get a Bullet Bill to fire for the last Dragon Coin
Slight cutoff when spikes are on top of launchers
Could use more variety in sprites to demonstrate the stomp's interactions

1-2
Feels too short... or maybe I just wanted to hear more of the song
Might want another visual pass (no "ruins" theming yet, and 3D space is a little confusing with non-semi solid ground appearing both in front of and behind the water)
Inviting the player to stomp down into ? blocks implies they'd actually activate
No real reason to follow the blue coins down while spinning/stomping
Lot of empty water and open sky just off the beaten path implies secrets or allows skips
Unsure how to explain to the player why Classic Goombas don't give a bounce when stomping like you'd expect

1-3
Same color for Layer 2 blocks and background may not be ideal
Likely to get hit by a Ball and Chain in boss room before you notice it's there

2-1
This is my level I nitpick to death so not much to say here

2-2
Visual pass not yet finished (although it's probably fine)
Last powerup is after anything could possibly hurt you

2-3
Some randomizations have jumps that are a little too much for Mario
Some randomizations leave koopas stuck clipped into walls

3-1
Fix classic piranha vines still being fish
I think we wanted to redesign the 2nd Dragon Coin area a bit upon learning climbable semisolids let you go down?
Lot of free Dragon Coins in this one, even if the first one is intentional

3-2
Weird thing going on with Layer 3 priority here
Not sure how I feel about wood-colored stone pillars or wood submerged in lava
Question blocks at the end seem like they should be more of a bonus than a requirement

3-3
Game lags near some of the Hotheads
Boss room Hothead is clever but it despawning may catch casual players off-guard, maybe use reskinned Spiny Blocks instead?
Need a mixed ExGFX for the Hothead in the boss room if it stays

4-1
Lots of lag around the Goomba stacks
Might want another visual pass (same comment re: 3D space, and feels overreliant on basic pillars)

4-2
First saw often despawns, should be placed all the way to the right
Rhino Gate (TM) seems a little rough when combined with getting out of water
Might want another visual pass (same comment re: 3D space, and orange water under a blue sky in a "lava" level would imply that it's unsafe)
Cloud platforms seem like an opportunity to use semisolids more thematic to the hack like wood or mushrooms
Free mushroom just for the last saw is a little odd
It was mentioned we should change the shell ending to not have softlock potential

4-3
Sometimes Dolphins don't spawn behind you when you'd expect them to when you need to slow down in the generator section

5-1
Visual pass not quite finished
Can sometimes miss out on getting the Mushroom after the checkpoint due to the Pokey

5-2
Getting hurt for not having the foresight to step on one of the timed platforms near the start might be a little frustrating
Mostly just needs a visual pass to be consistent with 5-1

5-3
Make Wario/Waluigi/Boo room entrance pipes one-way so you don't lose progress
Unsure what the blank Map16 next to the pipes in the Daisy room are
Boo Boss is a good idea in theory but centered around Wario/Mario/Wario again in practice -- Luigi can't even get the middle one because it's a Turn Block
Wario is pretty likely to faceplant into an Eerie while dashing
Have to die and start over if you run out of powerups without uncovering all the throwblocks or waste any of them
Green blocks look weird because of sharing an outline color with the background structures
Need a castle destruction scene / etc after this explaining that Mario got taken away

6-1
Lakitu often leaves Spinies stuck in walls
Pink outlines in the yellow palette resulting from the pink Munchers look odd

6-2
Could use a visual pass with more mushrooms etc
Doesn't automatically walk you downward on the OW when finishing the level

6-3
As charming of an idea as it is for Waluigi to panic Boost Jump at the Bony Beetle before the checkpoint, he's kinda screwed without a cape

6-4
Obviously this needs a fancier lobby and a bit more visual polish
I should add a checkpoint to the end of my room
The last section of my room sucks for Peach if she touches the floor
Kamek Boss doesn't play the correct victory music for some reason

6-5
Currently just an unfinished credits room with map music
